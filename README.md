### About

CosCMS is a simple modular framework for building web application.

Modules are distrubuted as profile, and a few is included in 
the main package. E.g. a simple CMS system and a blogging system.  
 
Easy to use, administer, and extend with modules 
(web- and shell modules, and templates). 
Export websites as simple profiles - which then can be build 
using the shell and git. 

You will need PHP >= 5.3, Apache, and a MySQL database. 

Tested with Apache2 on Debian systems, and Windows. 
Should work anywhere, even though it is build on Debian systems.
